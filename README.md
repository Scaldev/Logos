# Dynamic Epistemic Structures as First-order Interpretations

First-Order Dynamic Epistemic Logic (FODEL) structures arise from the iterative update of an
initial model by event triggering. Such structures are of utter importance for automated planning
reasonning and solving. On the other hand, First-Order Interpretations (FOI) relate relational
structures in a formal way by means of reinterpreting a structure into another.

This project is about the relationship between the FODEL update mechanism and FOI.
