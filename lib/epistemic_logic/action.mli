  [post e p] returns the formula to which the atomic proposition [p]
  is mapped to after the event [e] happens.

(**
    [size_of_event e] returns the size of the event [e].

(**
  [max_ap_of_events es] returns the greatest atomic proposition integer mentionned
  in this event.
*)

(**
  [pp_of_event c e] returns a pretty-print of an event [e] given [c].
  It's a table with one column and 2 rows. The first row contains the
  precondition formula, and the second row contains the postconditions formulas,
  one per line.

  Example:

    |   m_a := âŠ¥     |
    |   m_b := âŠ¤     |
