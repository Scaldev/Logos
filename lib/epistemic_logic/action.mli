type event = {
  eid: int;
  pre: fmla;
  post: (int * fmla) list;
}

(**
  [post e p] returns the formula to which the atomic proposition [p]
  is mapped to after the event [e] happens.
*)
val post : event -> int -> fmla

(**
    [size_of_event e] returns the size of the event [e].
*)
val size_of_event : event -> int

(**
  [max_ap_of_events es] returns the greatest atomic proposition integer in an
  event [e] of [es].
*)
val max_ap_of_events : event list -> int

(**
  [pp_of_event c e] returns a pretty-print of an event [e] given [c].
  It's a table with one column and 2 rows. The first row contains the
  precondition formula, and the second row contains the postconditions
  formulas, one per line.

  Example:
  {[
    +----------------+
    | pre: (m_a âˆ§ d) |
    +----------------+
    | post:          |
    |   m_a := âŠ¥     |
    |   m_b := âŠ¤     |
    +----------------+
